        Hello! I'm Jadon, a second year engineering science student majoring in biomedical engineering at UofT. Course descriptions for required program courses can be viewed [here](https://engineering.calendar.utoronto.ca/section/Engineering-Science).
        In addition to the core courses, I have audited/taken courses in physiology and biomedical imaging with a focus in MRI. I am currently taking courses in molecular cardiology and microprocessors/microcontrollers. Course notes
        for extra coruses can be viewed [here](https://github.com/jadontsai/school-notes).
        Outside of school, I'm currently working with the university of toronto biomed design team (UTBIOME) to build a vortex droplet generator as part of an AST mircoscope. I'm also a member of the [Iron Dragons](https://www.instagram.com/skuledragonboat/) dragon boat team that 
        placed second nationally at the 2024 Canadian National championships. On good weather weekends, I work as a line pilot at the Borden cadet flying site, as well as part time as a ground school instructor with Air Cadets Canada.
